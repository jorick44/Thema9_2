  abstract = "Substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the
              biology of pancreatic cancer, and advances in patients'
              management have also taken place. Evidence is beginning to show
              that screening first-degree relatives of individuals with several
              family members affected by pancreatic cancer can identify
              non-invasive precursors of this malignant disease. The incidence
              of and number of deaths caused by pancreatic tumours have been
              gradually rising, even as incidence and mortality of other common
              cancers have been declining. Despite developments in detection
              and management of pancreatic cancer, only about 4\% of patients
              will live 5 years after diagnosis. Survival is better for those
              with malignant disease localised to the pancreas, because
              surgical resection at present offers the only chance of cure.
              Unfortunately, 80-85\% of patients present with advanced
              unresectable disease. Furthermore, pancreatic cancer responds
              poorly to most chemotherapeutic agents. Hence, we need to
              understand the biological mechanisms that contribute to
              development and progression of pancreatic tumours. In this
              Seminar we will discuss the most common and deadly form of
              pancreatic cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.",
